    <h2>Proposition: Decrease in abortion facilities in a state results in a decrease in the number of abortions by residents of a state.</h2>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="figs/For.jpeg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					A visualization showing the relationship between percentage of abortions of state residents' happening in the state, the number of abortions in the state and the number of abortion clinics in the state. All the data is from the year of 2020. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Using red to depict a greater number of abortions in the cloropleth map and pie chart.
					<ul>
						<li>This was a decision I took while lurking through some reddit forums of anti-abortion groups. Several people refer to abortions as "murders" or "deaths" and I found that capturing greater number in abortions in red to symbolize blood would be persuasive for the story of this visualization. </li>
						<li>Prior to this I did try other colour gradients including a diverging scale of blue and red. I found that only a red gradient (as used in the final design) tells a stronger story since all the data points are depicting the number of abortions.</li>
						<li><b>Score: -1</b>, I think this decision was pretty deceptive in terms of affiliating abortion with death. However I feel that it is a little subtle and might thus get lost for the reader and thus settled on a score of -1.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>I also used icons of human figures as markers on the map. The goal was as stated above to associate abortion with the killing of life.
					<ul>
						<li>I experimented with other symbols such as circles, arrows and other markers. I decided to stick with the icon because of the story that comes with it as explained above.</li>
						<li><b>Score: -1.5.</b> I also feel like this decision is pretty deceptive. I think it is a little less subtle than point number 1, and thus have given myself a slightly lower score.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>I adjusted the size of the icon such that the 0 was not nearly invisible. The convention seems to be to make zero as an almost invisible size, and so this decision felt a little unconventional to me. This decision also makes it difficult to see a variation in size clearly in the map because the range of sizes was reduced to some extent. This was done to ensure that each state had a visible icon.
					<ul>
						<li><b>Score: 0.5.</b> I don’t think this was a very deceptive decision because I was just trying to make sure that viewers could see data points for each state. It is unconventional though and the lack of range in size might cause some confusion.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>In the cloropleth map and pie chart, I am comparing percentage of resident’s abortions in or out of state to the total number of abortions per state.
					<ul>
						<li>This is an unfair comparison because percentages are already normalized for the total number of abortions in the state. Thus making claims such as “lower percentage of in-state abortions implies lower total number of abortions in the state” as is in the text, is pretty baseless. </li>
						<li>This was a choice I made by design because I knew the point of view that I wanted to convey with this chart. I did experiment with using real numbers as opposed to percentages (as I have done in the next chart) in the chloropleth map and pie charts, but I found that using percentages along with total number of abortions fit the narrative better.</li>
						<li>Similarly in the pie chart, I grouped together states that have lesser than 20% of resident's abortions in-state and greater than 20% of resident's abortions in-state. In the pie chart however, I have reported the total number of abortions. What is unfair here is that the first group less than 20% contains only 17 states and the other group includes 34 states. This imbalance has not been accounted for in any way or mentioned in the annotation.</li>
						<li>I also considered displaying the pie chart information as bars, with each group as a bar. However I decided on the pie chart because it gave a sense of the contribution of each group towards the total number of abortions.</li>
						<li><b>Score: -2.</b> I think this was pretty deceptive, and unless a viewer is actively interacting with and thinking about the data they might take these results for granted.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>In the scatter plot, I tried to add a trend line and also converted the x-axis to a logarithmic scale to force a trend curve to appear.
					<ul>
						<li>The trend curve moves upwards significantly only because of some outliers on the top left. I added it because without the curve there is no clear pattern upon first glance.</li>
						<li>I add an upwards arrow along with the text annotation to drive the point home.</li>
						<li><b>Score: -1.5. </b>Without looking closely at the log axis or thinking about the outliers, this plot makes it pretty clear that as the number of abortion clinics increase, the number of abortions by state of residence also increases. This feels pretty deceptive to me.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>I also played around with the colour scale on the chloropleth map to see which one could show the most stark difference between states with lesser and greater percentage of abortions performed in state. After playing around with continuous palettes, I settled on a discrete one with 5 equally spaced bins through trial and error.
					<ul>
						<li><b>Score: -1.</b> I don’t think this is as deceptive as the other points that I have listed above, but it still feels ethically wrong to me. Upon further thought, I think it feels morally incorrect to me because I don't believe in this point of view (more on this in the final reflections section).
						</li>
					</ul>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="figs/Against.jpeg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Figure representing the abortion burden carried by different states in the US. It also visualizes the case study of Illinois and it's neighbours in the context of abortion burden borne and explores the facilities that different states are equipped with.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Use of abortion burden as a proxy of number of abortions handled in the state that are not for the residents of the state. Using this measure allows us to compare apples and apples as compared to the issue faced with the previous visualization.
					<ul>
						<li><b>Score: 1.5.</b> I don’t think this choice is particularly deceptive. It is allowing for a fairer comparison with number of abortions per state. I put a 1.5 instead of 2 because when I made this decision I was aware of the story that I was trying to tell so I wonder if the fact that this helped my story somehow coloured my decision.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The use of the chloropleth coloured by the abortion burden.
					<ul>
						<li>This was one of the visualizations I made when exploring the dataset. I was really intrigued by the patches of dark blue that were surrounded by orange states. These states were Illinois and Georgia and it is very cool to see how they see a high inflow of out of state people for abortion while the neighbours see an outflow of in-state residents for abortion. Placing these values on the map to see the spatial relationship among states made this point very clear.</li>
						<li><b>Score: 0.5.</b> The colouring doesn’t feel very deceptive, it is representative of the data.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Visualizing the number of abortions per state as circles.
					<ul>
						<li>I experimented with different types of marks inspired by the previous visualization but I felt like points looked the neatest and were able to communicate sizes the most clearly.</li>
						<li><b>Score: 2.</b> This feels earnest to me, it was a question of being able to see the markers clearly.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Colour palette: I chose to move away from the red colours as was the case with the previous visualization. This was intended as a choice to move away from the idea that “abortion is murder”.
					<ul>
						<li>I chose blue and brown because I wanted a diverging palette and liked how blue and brown looked. However later on I realised that this might easily be confused with a political party map (blue for democrats and red for republicans). While there is a correlation between party and their stance on abortion, this is not what I was trying to capture in this visualization. I might have changed this to another colour in the next iteration.</li>
						<li><b>Score: -1. </b>I think it might be deceptive because of the confusion with the political affiliation of the state.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Through the map, I wanted to highlight the fact that there is mostly no correlation between number of abortions and the abortion burden borne by states, when we exclude the top n outliers of adoption burden (such as Illinois, Georgia, Missouri. South Carolina). However I couldn’t think of a good way to visualize “no correlation”. I tried using scatter plots but it is very underwhelming to see no correlation from a plot. Thus I settled on using markers on the plot along with colour as is the case here. I added textual annotation to highlight that I wanted to talk about no correlation being present between both the number of abortions and abortion burden.
					<ul>
						<li><b>Score: 1.5.</b> I see this as an earnest decision.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					In the bar chart, I wanted to highlight that the states that bear a high abortion burden don’t necessarily do so simply because they have good facilities. As we saw in the map, it is also because the neighboring states don’t provide enough resources. In some ways by reducing the number of abortion facilities, states are just displacing the abortions to another's state as opposed to getting rid of them. 
					<ul>
						<li>I tried visualizing the number of abortion clinics on the x-axis. However I felt that this was unfair because each state has a different population and different abortion needs. I thus decided to normalize the x-axis axis by the number of clinics per number of occurred abortions occurring in the state.</li>
						<li><b>Score: 0.5.</b> I think this decision came from an earnest place. It also helped with my story so I wonder if it was not fully earnest.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					I really wanted to highlight the pockets of dark blue surrounded by orange. In order to do this, I wanted to study the case of Illinois with a line plot.
					<ul>
						<li>I chose to plot the average of the number of state resident’s abortions per clinic and the average of the number of occurred abortions per clinic on the y-axis. The x axis is the value corresponding to these values.</li>
						<li>I created two groups for this: Illinois in group 1 and Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri and Wisconsin in group 2. I took this decision because I saw a similar downward trend in the group 2 states which was distinct from group 1. For my story, I really just wanted to highlight the change in the direction of slope as opposed to the magnitude of the slope. Therefore I decided to group the states in group 2.</li>
						<li>In hindsight, I do think the average of occurrences of abortions per clinic might be a little unintuitive to wrap one’s head around when averaged over 4 states. This is because taking average of ratios doesn’t physically mean anything directly. I could consider calculating the total number of abortion occurences divided by total number of clincs across all 4 states in future iterations to make the metric more intuitive.</li>
						<li>I thought of the y-axis quantities as a measure of how many abortions the state was handling given it’s resource (Average number of state resident’s abortions per clinic) vs. how many abortions the state was being forced to handle given it’s resources (Average occurrence of abortion per clinic). I think this is captured with the metrics in the figure.</li>
						<li>I worry that this visualization might not be as clear. I tried various versions of groupings, bars, scatters and pie charts. However, I thought the difference in slant direction was the clearest communication of my intended story that I could come up with.</li>
						<li><b>Score: -1.</b> The grouping I made and choice of values on the y axis were made to promote my story as discussed above.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      I found this assignment extremely challenging. This is because I went into the mindset of creating a visualization with the knowledge of what I want to convey. For the first visualization, I didn’t even believe in what I was trying to convey which made the task even more difficult. To better understand this foreign perspective, I spent a significant amount of time going through anti-abortion forums and reading articles to understand why certain groups of people don’t support abortion. In some ways it felt like I was an actor getting ready to play a role. As I made both the visualizations, I found myself increasingly thinking about the story I wanted to convey and making design decisions based on that narrative. <br>

		This is different from previous assignments, where I made visualizations based on information that I gathered from data exploration and something that I truly believed in. While creating any visualization, throughout the design process I play an adversarial role to myself; taking on the hat of designer and viewer, I tried to decide how to best communicate the story. This process became quite confusing for me this time because I didn’t have a set of morals to fall back on, but rather had to rely on a “tailored story” that I was trying to tell which was disorienting. <br>
		
		The entire process felt quite unethical to me. As a designer I was forcibly trying to make myself convey a certain message that I didn’t fully believe in. This made me think of how I make figures for my scientific research. In that case also I’m very much trying to support my story, however the difference is that I truly understand and believe in the story that I am trying to tell in the latter case. This led me to think that the line between acceptable persuasive choices and misleading ones is very blurry and to me it feels like only the designer can know what kind of choice they are making based on a set of morals that they believe in. Even while scoring my design choices for the second visualization - a story that I support - I can’t fully be sure that all my decisions were persuasion free. However I’m sure that they are relatively a little more "ethical" than the design decisions in the first visualization. Perhaps there is a world that designers have a standardized code of ethics that they need to follow and swear to before becoming a professional. This might help one decide if their decisions are ethical or not in times of confusion. However this is largely dependent on an individual's determination to uphold their moral principles, which is difficult to regulate in practice. <br>
